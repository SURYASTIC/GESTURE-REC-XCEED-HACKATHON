# Hand-Gesture-Recognition

>Hand Gesture Recognition using matlab

### This System is a prototype system that helps to recognize hand gesture to normal people in order to avoid accidents in the road.
This focuses on the problem of gesture recognition in real time that sign language used by the community of deaf people and dumb people.
This problem is addressed using **Skin Detection**, **Image Segmentation**,**Image Filtering**, and **Template Matching techniques**.This system recognizes gestures of ASL (AmericanSign Language) including the alphabet.

## Objective

- This system focuses on the problem of gesture recognition in real time that sign language used by the community of deaf people.And uses Color Segmentation,Skin Detection, Image Segmentation, ImageFiltering, and Template Matching techniques like Correlation.
- This system recognizes gestures of ASL including the alphabet.And uses Template matching for matching the gesture to keep it simple,other methods include neural networks.
